            <h2>What is MDS and Anemia?</h2>
            <p>
              MDS is a rarwe blood cancer in which blood cells in the bone
              marrow do not grow to become healthy red blood cells,white blood
              cells,or platelets - all the vital components of blood.Not being
              able to develop healthy red blood cells leads to anemia,which is
              common with MDS,Anemia has many of the same symptoms as MDS and
              causes even greater fatigue
            </p>
            <p>
              It can be exhausting to live with a condition that makes you feel
              like you've being held back.If you're caring for a loved one with
              the condition,it can be equally trying.However,right now,research
              is underway on an investigational study drug to see if it may halp
              alleviate anemic symptoms and better managae your MDS.And you may
              be able to take part in this study
